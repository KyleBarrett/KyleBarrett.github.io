### Bio
<img src="www/images/FB_profile.jpg" style="width:25%; border:10px solid; margin-right: 20px" align="left">
I graduated Drexel in 2019 with a BS in chemical engineering. I have research and lab experience in PKPD modeling, biological colloids, and polymer chemistry. I'm currently on publications related to computational biology, ultrasound contrast agents, and body weight prediction software using image analysis. I currently market myself as an R shiny development, though am also proficient in R (data analysis & post processing), C++, HTML/CSS, and Creo Parametrics (3D modeling/printing). Looking forward, I plan to become more involved with software development and data analysis.

My full CV is available [here](files/Resume_new.pdf).

### Hobbies

 - Squash/weight lifting
